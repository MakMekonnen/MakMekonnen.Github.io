Requirements Met
- Created an about me with the necessary information and on my name it is a link to my Linkedln (click it)
- Contact button on the Nav that has a mailto reroute (click it)
- Three projects were included and shown in different ways, as a gif and as an image that lets you toggle between
- Nav Bar was integrated

Extra Credit
- Integrated a color wheel to allow the user to pick what color the want the background to be, this also changes the text from black to white or vice versa depending on how dark or bright the colors are.
