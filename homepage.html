        <p>Hello, my name is Makonnen Mekonnen and I am interested in a Software Engineering position! I am proficient in Java with familiarity in Python, HTML, CSS,  and JavaScript.

        <br>
        On my free time I enjoy photography and videography. I currently have a Fujifilm X-T5. Other than hobbies, I have a freelance job as a Compositor for 2D Animation working on all sorts of work from Indie animation to Professional Projects.

        I was born in Ethiopia, but moved to Canada when I was younger before then moving to the United States in 6th grade of Middle School. </p>
